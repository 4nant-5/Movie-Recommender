# 🎬 Movie Recommender System (Content-Based)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **content-based movie recommendation system** that suggests movies similar to a user-selected title. The recommendations are generated by analyzing movie metadata and computing **cosine similarity** between feature vectors.  

The system focuses on understanding user preferences based on movie content rather than relying on other users’ behavior, making it effective even with limited user interaction data.

A simple **GUI-based interface** is included to allow users to interactively select a movie and receive recommendations in real time.

## 🎯 Objective
- Build a recommendation system based on **movie content similarity**
- Apply **NLP preprocessing** techniques to textual data
- Use **cosine similarity** to measure similarity between movies
- Provide a user-friendly GUI for real-world usability

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data manipulation and preprocessing  
- **Scikit-learn** – Feature extraction and cosine similarity  
- **NLP Techniques** – Text preprocessing and stemming  
- **External APIs** – Movie metadata enrichment  
- **GUI Framework** – For interactive recommendation output  

---

## 📂 Dataset & Features
The dataset consists of movie-related metadata such as:
- Movie title  
- Overview / description  
- Genres  
- Keywords / tags  

These features are combined and transformed into a single textual representation for similarity computation.

## 🔄 Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned and standardized text data
- Removed unnecessary symbols and stop words
- Applied **stemming** to reduce words to their root form

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Combined relevant movie attributes into a single feature vector
- Converted text data into numerical vectors using feature extraction techniques

### 3. Similarity Computation
- Calculated **cosine similarity** between movie vectors
- Identified movies with the highest similarity scores

### 4. Recommendation Logic
- User selects a movie title
- System retrieves the most similar movies based on cosine similarity
- Top recommendations are displayed through the GUI

## 📊 Key Concepts Used
- Content-Based Recommendation Systems  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
- Cosine Similarity  
- Feature Vectorization  
- Text Preprocessing & Stemming  

---

## 🖥️ Application Interface
The project includes a **GUI-based interface** that:
- Accepts a movie title as input  
- Displays a list of recommended movies  
- Enables real-time interaction without command-line usage  

---

## ✅ Results
- Successfully generated relevant movie recommendations based on content similarity  
- Demonstrated effective use of NLP and similarity metrics  
- Delivered an intuitive interface suitable for non-technical users  

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add user ratings for hybrid recommendations  
- Integrate collaborative filtering  
- Deploy the application as a web-based system  
- Improve recommendation accuracy using advanced NLP models
